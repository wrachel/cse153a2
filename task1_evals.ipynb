    "\n",
    "We broke down our model evaluation into two parts: an objective analysis based on musical characteristics (more on this later), and a subjective analysis (in other words, a vibe check).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the objective analysis, we used a few metrics to evaluate our model. \n",
    "1. Perplexity -- a measure of how well the model predicts the next chord in a sequence, calculated as the exponential of the average negative log probability of the test sequences (see calculate_perplexity method). This is essentially a measure of the model's ability to capture the underlying musical structure of the data; a \"good\" model will have a lower perplexity.\n",
    "2. Chord Distribution -- comparison of the distribution of chords in the generated sequences to those in the test data using Counter objects (test_chord_dist and gen_chord_dist). We list the top 10 most common chords and their frequencies (as percentages) for both test and generated data. A \"good\" model should have a similar distribution to the test data, indicating that we're properly capturing Bach's musical vocabulary.\n",
    "3. Voice Leading Analysis -- computes the average absolute movement in semitones for each of the four voices (soprano, alto, tenor, bass) and identifies the most common pitch movements. This is a measure of the model's ability to match Bach's style in terms of voice leading and melodic motion. A \"good\" model will have a lower average absolute movement and more common pitch movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For subjective analysis, we rated the generated sequences based on how much we felt that the music was of high quality and sounded like Bach. We used a scale of 1-5, with 1 being the lowest quality and 5 being the highest quality. This is mostly just a sense check to see if the objective measures align with our subjective impressions. This was done by converting our generated output to MIDI files and listening to them. "
